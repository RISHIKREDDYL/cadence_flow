* Resource oriented programming

### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

* **Safety and Security:** Any digital space needs to protect the end-users thus a safe environment should be provided and it is equally essential to protect the blockchain from security threats.
* **Clarity:** Spaghetti code will be eliminated so less redundant code or DRY code will be left in the program which leads to efficiency and good developer experience
* **Approachability:** Easy to understand or transition from another programming language with similar syntax.
* **Developer experience:** Better developer experience leads to more developers adopting the language and easy debugging.
